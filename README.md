Building an AI powered backend with FASTAPI and the OpenAI API.

1. Created a virtual environment to keep the dependencies isolated.

You can recreate the virtual environment by running the following command:
```bash
python -m venv fastapi-openai
source fastapi-openai/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Created a routes folder to keep the routes organized. We then create a file called `__init__.py`. This file is used to tell Python that the routes folder is a package.
